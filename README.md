# IntroToML
In this repository, we will be exploring and focusing on the IBM Watson Data Platform to dive into working with the Machine Learning pipeline. This will include performing activities from data cleansing using the IBM Data Refinery service to creating a simple machine learning model using the IBM Watson Machine Learning service and creating an interactive dashboard using the Cognos Dashboard Embedded service to visualize data.

This repository used the following resource, which can be explored to look at each part in more depth:

![Create a new project](images/8.png)

## Adding the data assets
- You should be taken to a page showing an **Overview** of the project you just created
- Click on **Assets** on the panel found under the name of your project at the top of the page
- At the top right of the page, click on the icon that has zeros and ones (two of each)
- Click on **Load** and drag and drop the files **adult_income.csv**, which can be found this GitHub repository under the folder **Data sets**.

![Adding data assets](images/9.png)

- You will notice that once the files are uploaded, they will be added under **Data assets**.

## Part 1: Data Refinery
- Go to the triple dot menu next to next to **adult_income.csv** under **Data assets** and select **Refine**

![Data tab](images/11.png)

- On the panel on the right, you will find **Details** including the project the data asset belongs to, and description of the resulting data set we will get after the refining process. Close it for the time being

![Data tab](images/12.png)

- Click on **Steps**, which you can find right hand-side of the page. This is where you will see each operation you will define while transforming the data. It shows the data flow defining the operations to be done on the entire data set

- Click on the **Profile** tab and talk quick look at data summary and get a feel of you data (do this after skimming through your data displayed in the **Data** tab)

![Profile tab](images/13.png)

- Click on the **Profile** tab and take a closer look at the column *GENDER*. You will notice some additional values other than *Male* and *Female*, mainly ones that we want to change to *Male*.

![Harmonization data in the *GENDER* field](images/14.png)

- Click on **+Operation** and select **Replace substring**, which you can find under **CLEANSE**.
- Choose *GENDER* as the **Selected column**. Under **Pattern** tab, type <i>^(?!(Male|Female))([Mm].*)</i> under **Regular expression** and *Male* under **Enter the string replace with**. Make sure to select **Replace all occurrences**.

What is meant by <i>^(?!(Male|Female))([Mm].*)</i> is to find any expression that doesn't start with *Male* or *Female* and starts with the letter *M* or *m*, which could be followed by any character.

![regex](images/regex.png)

- Click **Apply** and go to the **Profile** tab again to for a final check.

![Harmonization data in the *GENDER* field 2](images/16.png)

- Click on the **Profile** tab and take a closer look at the column *AGE*

![Harmonization data in the *AGE* field](images/17.png)

- Click on **+Operation** and select **Split column**, which you can find under **ORGANIZE**.
- Choose *AGE* as the **Selected column**. Under **POSITION** tab, type *2* under **Positions** and *AGE_num,AGE_str* under the **Names of new columns**. Make sure to unselect **Keep original column**
- Click **Apply**.

Bear in mind that this is not the best approach to handle this. This is just provide an example of how to use the **split column** operation.

![Harmonization data in the *AGE* field 2](images/18.png)

- Go to the **Data** tab and remove the newly created column called *AGE_str*, which only contain the string part of the age.

![Harmonization data in the *AGE* field 2](images/19.png)

- Go to column called *AGE_num* and rename it to *AGE*

![Harmonization data in the *AGE* field 2](images/20.png)

- Go to the **Profile** tab again to for a final check.

- Click on the **Profile** tab and take a closer look at the column *MARITAL_STATUS*

![Removing empty rows](images/21.png)

- Go to the **Data** tab
- Go to the column called *MARITAL_STATUS* and remove rows with any empty values by clicking on the triple dot menu next to the column name and selecting **Remove empty rows**

![Removing empty rows](images/22.png)

- Go to the **Profile** tab to check if all empty values have been removed.

- Go to the **Data** tab.
- Go to the column called *AGE* and change its type to Integer by clicking on the triple dot menu next to the column name and selecting **CONVERT COLUMN TYPE** followed by selecting **Integer**.

![Change the column data type](images/23.png)

- In the same way, change the data type of *HOURS_PER_WEEK* and INCOME_NUM* to **Integer**, and *CAPITAL_GAIN* and *CAPITAL_LOSS* to **Decimal**.

![Change the column data type](images/24.png)

- At this point, you should have 10 **Steps**
- Click on the play button to run the data flow as seen below.

![save&run](images/25.png)

- Change the **Name** under **Data flow details** to *adult_income.csv_flow* and the **Name** under **Data flow output** to *adult_income_shaped.csv*.
- Click on **Save and Run**

![Running the data flow 2](images/26.png)

- In the window that pops up, click on **View Flow** to track the progress of the running data flow.

![Running the data flow 2](images/27.png)

- The data flow should start running, executing each of the operations we defined. If things goes well, you should see the page similar to the one displayed below.
